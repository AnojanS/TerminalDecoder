# TerminalHacker
A word game played in an imported replica terminal on Unity where users attempt to unscramble a set of given words based on the difficulty they choose.

By including classes, switch statements, if statements, cases and other fundamentals, this game served an intro to programming with C# and the dynamics of the Unity Engine.

To launch, open and run Terminal_Hacker/Assets/Game.unity in Unity.
